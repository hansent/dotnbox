## How to play

 - the youngest player starts the game
 - take turns picking horizontal edges ("--") or vertical edges ("|").
 - to "make a line" for that edge, replace "--"" with "##", or "|" with "#" .
 - if you close a box, write P1/P2 or your initials in the middle
 - if you close a box, you also get to go again
 - once all boxes are closed, player with the most boxes wins!
